FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
PORT=5000
```

### Security Checklist for Production
- [ ] Change default JWT secret
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up MongoDB with authentication
- [ ] Configure proper file upload limits
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Use environment-specific configurations
